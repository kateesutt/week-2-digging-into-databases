# Homework 1

**Due: Sept 15, 2020 by 11:59pm ET**

## Datasets

* Indego Bikeshare data station status data
* Indego Trip data
  - Q2 2020
  - Q2 2019

All data is available from [Indego's Data site](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/). Feel free to use the [Station Data from last week](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MUSA-509/week-1-introductions/master/data/indego_station_status.geojson) if it is not already in your account.

Load all three datasets into your CARTO account.

## 1. How many bike trips in Q2 2019?


```SQL
SELECT count(*)
FROM ksutton.indego_trips_2019_q2
```

**Result:** 206354

## 2. What is the percent change in trips in Q2 2020 as compared to Q2 2019?

Using only the table from Q2 2020 and the number calculated in the previous question, find the percent change of number of trips in Q2 2020 as compared to 2019. Remember you can do calculations in the select clause.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

__Bonus: If you want to get fancier here, you can cast the result to a string and concatenate a `'%'` to the end. For example, `(10 + 3.2)::text || '%' AS perc_change`. This uses the type casting (number to string) and string concatenation operator (`||`, double pipes) that's essentially a `+` for strings.__

## 3. What are the average durations of each year?

**Average duration of a trip for 2019.**

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```
**Result:**

**Average duration of a trip for 2020.**

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```
**Result:**

**What do you notice about the difference in trip lengths? Give a few explanations for why there could be a difference here.**

**Answer:**

## 4. What is the longest duration trip?

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

**Why are there so many trips of this duration?**

**Answer:**

## 5. How many trips were shorter than 10 minutes?

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 6. How many trips started on one day and ended in the next?

Hint 1: date strings can be parsed using the text type to datetime type conversion function [`to_timestamp`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html). See the section on [Template Patterns for Date/Time Formatting](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING-DATETIME-TABLE) for options on choosing the right string format. The 2020 dataset has the timestamp in a slightly unusual format so you need to tell PostgreSQL how to parse it. The 2019 data should already be in a good format.

Hint 2: Days of the month can be retrieved from a timestamp using the [EXTRACT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT) function. See also some of the follow alongs from the Lecture in week 2.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 7. Give the five most popular stations between 7am and 10am.

Using the Q2 2019 trip data, give the five most popular stations.

Hint: Use the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour of the day from the timestamp.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**


## 8. List all the passholder types and number of trips for each.

In one query, give a list of all `passholder_type` options and the number of trips taken by `passholder_type`.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 9. Using the station status dataset, find the distance in meters of all stations from Meyerson Hall.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

Don't worry about listing the full result, just give the query.

## 10. What is the average distance (in meters) of all stations from Meyerson Hall?

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 11. How many stations are within 1km of Meyerson Hall?

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 12. How many stations are within 2km of Meyerson Hall?

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 13. Which station is furthest from Meyerson Hall?

Write a query that returns only one line, and only gives the station id, station name, and distance from Meyerson Hall.

```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**

## 14. Which station is closest to Meyerson Hall?

Write a query that returns only one line, and only gives the station id, station name, and distance from Meyerson Hall.


```SQL
-- Enter your SQL query here
```

**Result:**
